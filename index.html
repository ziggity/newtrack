              <p id="rubyimg"> <img src = "http://mysandboxonline.dia-box.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ruby_and_rails.jpg" alt = "rubyrails"> <br>Ruby/Rails track is best for you based on the data since you chose a lot of A's. Ruby is great for building interactive web apps, gathering input from users, dynamic content, and simply common tasks. It's most popular with startups for building out quickly (Ruby for the frontend and backend with Rails framework). </br></p>

              <p id="phpimg"> <img src = "http://allabouttodd.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/article_images/drupal-php.jpg?itok=KFiigr8x" alt = "phpdrupal"> <br>PHP/Drupal track is best for you based on the data since you chose a lot of B's. PHP/Drupal is super secure, the US goverment uses it for their website, Wordpress is built on PHP, for super fast deployment for content heavy websites. Content Management Systems like Wordpress, use PHP to create large complex websites. This is great for building out brands and sites on your own.</br></p>

              <p id="javaimg"> <img src ="http://triposoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JAVAANDROID.jpg" alt="java"> <br>Java/Android track is best for you based on the data since you chose a lot of C's. Java is amazing for corporate enterprises because it's most popular language, used in everything from Android apps, GUI, to software applications. Enterprise level companies love Java for it's high performance and vast popularity with developers. Some software that used Java are: adobe photoshop, video games, tax software.</br></p>

              <p id="designimg"> <img src = "https://www.sololearn.com/Uploads/html-css.jpg" alt = "Design"> <br>CSS/Design track is best for you based on the data. CSS/Design is great for visual people, such as photographers, video editors, artists in general. Here is where you can design for mobile first, or focus on desktop and scale down from there! Use your art skills to create a wonderful experience for users to view and interact with an elegant website.</br></p>

              <p id="csharpimg"> <img src ="https://assets.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-133cb67a060cbb79455b67bd45a6ea6a" alt="csharp"> <br>C#/.NET track is best for you based on the data based on the data since you chose a mix of B's and C's. C#/.NET is a huge software language with a plethora of uses, but keep in mind Microsoft built C# shortly after Java was released, and so it was released with a caveat that it can only be used with other Microsoft technologies as to hinder the competition, and force developers to use all of their products. Different thinking compared to Java where you can work in an open source environment. Although Microsoft has released C# to be open source, not all of their products are open source, so it's not really true to the cause. Best for giant corporations who want secure, and well written software to build programs like adobe photoshop. </br></p>
